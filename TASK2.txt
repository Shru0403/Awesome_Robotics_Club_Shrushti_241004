I am quite interested in "Mechanical Turk" project because it combines robotics and computer vision. I have been learning machine learning and computer vision since December and this project will give me an excellent opportunity to apply whatever i have learnt till now as well as help me in learning new skills related to robotics. Moreover, I have played several chess tournaments (state level and national level) in my childhood so creating a chess bot fascinates me so much and it has been there in my bucketlist since childhood
