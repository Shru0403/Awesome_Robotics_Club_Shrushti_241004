Hey! I am Shrushti Fulzele, and this repository contains my analysis and solutions to Problem 6 of the robotics club secretary recruitment tasks. We had to design a detection system for a robot playing chess, but we weren't allowed to use computer vision, magnetic sensors or RFID. I came up with three solutions, one which I delved into in detail. 

1. IR Reflective Sensors
2. Chess Pieces with conductive material and resistance grid
3. Force Sensitive Resistors(FSR's) - This method proved to be a superior choice compared to the other two methods, which is why we have explained it in detail.
